# Code of Conduct for GoSnap

## Introduction

This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for participants within the GoSnap community, as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior. We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment for all members, regardless of their background or identity.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

## Consequences for Unacceptable Behavior

Participants asked to stop any unacceptable behavior are expected to comply immediately. If a participant engages in unacceptable behavior, project maintainers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the project.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior—or have any other concerns—please report it by contacting us at [sbhagat_be23@thapar.edu]. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
